# Connect-4
An implementation of Connect 4 in Python 3.x using the Pygame library.

The win-checking algorithm is very compacted but not that flexible but can work with any board size from 4x4.\
However, the engine draws the board at a fixed resolution and size, so to remodel the board requires some extensive changes.

# Requirements
