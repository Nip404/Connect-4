# Connect-4
An implementation of Connect 4 in Python 3.x using the Pygame library.

I have tried to compact the algorithm for checking for a win as much as possible, so it may appear quite cluttered.\
Rest assured, it works well with any size of board of size 4x4 or bigger.

# Requirements
I am using the [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) IDLE.\
Download project and run main.py to use.\
Python 3.x and Pygame 1.7.x or above is required.\
You can download pygame either [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) or [here](https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads/).
